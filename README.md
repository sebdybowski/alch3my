## About
**Alch3my** _(pronounced: 'Alchemy')_ is a monorepo project that provides set of reusable react components. You may ask: `Why another component library!?`. Let me answer:
- **Pick only what you need** - Alch3my provides you a way to choose what packages you exactly want to install. This applies to css also!
- **100% Accessibility** - Components are built to match all A11y requirements.
- **Highly configurable** - You can pass all native HTML attributes you would normally want to pass through the props of Alch3my components.

## Getting started
To install certain packages you can do:
```shell
npm i -S @alch3my/input @alch3my/table
```

To install entire Alch3my:
```shell
npm i -S alch3my
```
